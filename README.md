# Transitions

An example app showing several ways to customize UIViewController transitions.

## Branch: master

Basic animated transitions, shows how to easily implement select animations: 

* Barndoor: doors/clouds slide opened and closed
* Bubbles: water + bubbles shimmy and slide up the screen and then fades
* Closing: doors close (e.g. end of game)
* Opening: doors open (e.g. start of game)
* Sandstorm: sand slides in from left and fades
* Snowstorm: snow drops in from top and fades

Includes a pan gesture recognizer to interactively control some of the transitions.
